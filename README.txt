Project Overview:
StockAI is an AI-driven application that uses historical stock market data to forecast future stock prices. Designed as a tool for aspiring investors, students, and anyone interested in understanding market trends, StockAI applies machine learning models to predict the possible direction of stock prices. This predictive capability is based on patterns and insights drawn from the historical performance of various stocks.

Technology Stack:

Programming Language: Python
Framework: Streamlit (for web application deployment)
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib

Key Features:

Stock Prediction: Upload a .csv file containing the historical stock value, and predict it's future value using AI.
Data Visualization: View historical trends and patterns in an interactive graphical format.
User-Friendly Interface: An intuitive interface built using Streamlit that is easy to navigate for both beginners and experienced users.
File Information:

app.py :
This is the main Python file for the project, containing all Streamlit code and logic for StockAI.
It fetches historical data, processes it, and uses machine learning algorithms to predict future stock prices.
The file also includes code to visualize data and provide an interactive user experience.
